<p><strong>第三部分：阅读理解（共20小题，每题2分，满分40分）</strong></p>
<p>阅读下列短文，从每题所给的四个选项（A、B、C和D）中，选出最佳选项。</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>For twenty or thirty years Ernest Faber had owned cars of different sorts , and had driven them regularly , not only in England, but also in many countries of Europe and the Middle East . He was glad to think that he was an experienced driver , because he heard frequent complaints about the difficulties of passing the driving tests in these modern days . He was told that people tried unsuccessfully to pass the test five , seven , or even thirteen times . He heard of one man who failed the test , did no driving at all for a month , and then passed the next test without difficulty . One woman said that she failed several times in one part of the country . And so she went to another town and immediately passed . Faber was not sure whether to believe such stories or not .But he began to think that the results of the tests were frequently unreasonable .</p>
<p>Although it did not affect him in the least , Faber grew angry about all this . He decided to take the test himself . He was an excellent driver ;and if he failed , that would prove that his doubts about the examiners were correct . And then he would write to the newspapers to tell everyone what happened .</p>
<p>About two months later the following letter appeared in one of the leading papers of England : &ldquo;Dear sir .</p>
<p>During the last twenty-seven years I have driven cars thousands of miles in thirteen different countries in all sorts of weather , and have never had an accident . I have never damaged anything belonging to anybody , and I have never seen the inside of a court of justice . I can take a motor-car engine to pieces and put it together again , and I have given driving lessons to men and women who have later passed the test . No policeman has ever said a sharp word to me . I am not a stupid person , and I have two university degrees .</p>
<p>For some time , I have felt doubtful about the driving test held in this country , because their results often seem unreasonable . I therefore decided that the time had come to test the examiners themselves . If anyone can drive a car , I can . I therefore paid the pound and sent my application in . It is unnecessary to tell you that I did not mention my great experience , my unusual ability as a driver , or my wide and exact knowledge of cars .</p>
<p>The day of the test came .</p>
<p>I very much regret to inform you that I passed .</p>
<p>Yours Faithfully</p>
<p>Ernest Faber&rdquo;</p>
<p>56．Faber&rsquo;s driving experience made him .</p>
<p>A．surprised B．satisfied C．destroyed D．troubled</p>
<p>57．It was said that the driving tests in different parts of the country were .</p>
<p>A．not equally difficult B．getting more and more difficult</p>
<p>C．intended to discourage women from driving D．intended to discourage people from owning cars</p>
<p>58．When Faber decided to take the test , .</p>
<p>A．he knew that he could do it free of charge B．he expected to get a driver&rsquo;s license</p>
<p>C．he wondered if he was an excellent driver D．he thought even he himself might fail the test</p>
<p>59．The letter tells us that the driving test is .</p>
<p>A．difficult B．unfair C．reasonable D．unbelievable</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>Imagine that you are on a jury (陪审团) and you hear the testimony of an eyewitness who says that the accused person is guilty . You would probably vote to convict the accused, don&rsquo;t you think ? Well, more often than not , you&rsquo;d be wrong .</p>
<p>A few years ago , an experiment was done on an evening news show on WNBC in New York .Viewers were shown a film of what seemed to be a mugging . In this simulation (模拟),a man snatched a woman&rsquo;s purse . He then knocked her down and ran face forward at the camera so that the viewers got a good look at him . Viewers were then shown a lineup of six men . They were asked to decide if the mugger was in the lineup and , if so , to tell which one he was . In effect , then, they had seven choices . The suspect (嫌疑犯) was either one of the six or he wasn&rsquo;t even in the lineup .</p>
<p>Of the 2,145 people who called up to respond , 1,843 were wrong . That means about one in seven was right . This is what you&rsquo;d expect from random choice .</p>
<p>Eyewitness accounts can be the most convincing evidence presented to a jury . Yet we are finding out that such accounts can be faulty . Something is just wrong . Why is this so ? Recent findings have removed doubts on whether memory can last long .We also know that it can be changed by things such as leading questions . Mistaken eyewitness accounts are common . They are also the major cause of innocent (无罪的) person being convicted in the United States .</p>
<p>60．The underlined words &ldquo;to convict the accused&rdquo; probably means .</p>
<p>A．to show that the accused is wrong B．to express that the accused person is true</p>
<p>C．to declare that the accused person is guilty D．to explain that the eyewitness is dangerous</p>
<p>61．Of the people who called up to respond , .</p>
<p>A．half of them were right B．2,145 were on a jury</p>
<p>C．six out of seven were wrong D．1,843 made seven choices</p>
<p>62．We also know that can be changed .</p>
<p>A．evidence B．memory C．eyewitness D．accounts</p>
<p>63．What is the passage mainly about ?</p>
<p>A．Evidence should be more convincing . B．Eyewitness accounts can be wrong.</p>
<p>C．Not all judges are good at their jobs . D．Major causes of innocent persons being convicted.</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>When you are advised to &ldquo;get an education&rdquo; if you want to raise your income , you are only told half the truth . What you should be told is to get just enough education to provide manpower for your society , but not too much education that would prove an embarrassment (窘迫) to your society .</p>
<p>Get a high school diploma (文凭), at least . Without that, you are occupationally dead , unless your name happens to be George Bernard Shaw or Thomas Alva Edison and you can successfully drop out in grade school .</p>
<p>Get a college degree , if possible . With a BA, you are on the launching pad . But now you have to start to put on the brakes . If you go for a master&rsquo;s degree , make sure it&rsquo;s an MBA, and only from a first-rate university . Beyond this ,the famous law of diminishing returns (报酬递减规律性)begins to take effect . Do you know , for instance , that heavy truck drivers earn more a year than full professors ? Yes , the average 1977 salary for those truckers was $ 24,000, while the full professor managed to average just $ 23,930.</p>
<p>A Ph. D is the highest degree you can get , but except in a few specialized fields such as physics or chemistry , where the degree can quickly be turned to industrial or commercial purposes , you are facing a dark future . There are more Ph. Ds unemployed or underemployed in this country than in any other part of the world by far .</p>
<p>If you become a doctor of Philosophy in English or History or Anthropology or Political Science or language or-worst of all-in Philosophy , you run the risk of becoming overeducated for our national demands .</p>
<p>Thousands of Ph. Ds are selling shoes , driving cabs , waiting on tables and filling out fruitless applications month after month . And then maybe taking a job in some high school or backwater (死气沉沉) college that pays much less than the janitor (门卫) earns .</p>
<p>Income and education are closely related . Far enough ,that is , to make you useful to the gross national product , but not so far that nobody can turn much of a profit on you .</p>
<p>64．According to the writer , what the society expects of education is to turn out people who .</p>
<p>A．will become loyal citizens to a nation B．can always take good care of themselves</p>
<p>C．will not be a shame to society or their families D．can meet the demands as a source of manpower</p>
<p>65．If you are as gifted as Bernard Shaw or Edison .</p>
<p>A．you can get a high school diploma without difficult</p>
<p>B．you can be professionally successful without a diploma</p>
<p>C．the least you should do is to get a diploma</p>
<p>D．you will be successful in grade school</p>
<p>66．Many Ph. Ds are out of work because .</p>
<p>A．they are of little commercial value to the society</p>
<p>B．they prefer easy jobs with more money</p>
<p>C．they are fewer jobs in high schools</p>
<p>D．they are wrongly educated</p>
<p>67．According to the passage , which of the following is NOT true ?</p>
<p>A．The higher your education level is , the more money you&rsquo;ll earn .</p>
<p>B．If you are too well-educated , you may make things difficult for the society</p>
<p>C．One must think carefully before going for a master&rsquo;s degree .</p>
<p>D．Bernard Shaw didn&rsquo;t finish high school, nor did Edison .</p>
<p>D</p>
<p>&ldquo;ONLY A COKE WILL DO&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t necessarily believe that new advertising , which might make consumers fell better about the Coke brand or better about the ads themselves , will actually result in consumers consuming more of the product,&rdquo; Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s Bill Pecoriello wrote in a research note the days after the investor ( 投资者) meeting . But Coke is optimistic it can regain its old magic , and is banking on a new slogan : &ldquo;Welcome to the Coke side of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BREAKTHROUGH HIT?</p>
<p>With PepsiCo about to surpass Coke as the beverage king on Wall Street&mdash;Pepsi&rsquo;s market capitalization has soared in recent years to $97.9 billion, putting it less than a billion dollars behind its rival (对手) &mdash;the heat is on Coke . It&rsquo;s set to launch a new marketing campaign in March , 2006. And having taken a quick look at Coke&rsquo;s investor presentation on Dec. 7 in New York , my sense is that Coke may be moving in the right direction .</p>
<p>Given the continued shift by consumers away from soda&mdash;Coke&rsquo;s stronghold &mdash;and into alternative beverages like juice , tea , and water , Coke badly needs a breakthrough hit . And given that shift away from soda , some analysts wonder whether even the catchiest new ads will be enough to put the fizz back into Coke .</p>
<p>SAME OLD , UPDATED.</p>
<p>The new flavors (口味) of PowerAde sports drink will probably enable Coke to continue stealing market share from PesiCo&rsquo;s Gatorade brand . And Coke is getting a little more creative with packaging , including new , aluminum bottles of Coke that will be sold in nightclubs , and an 8.4-ounce &ldquo;100 calorie&rdquo; version of its flagship Coke that will appeal to women who want fewer calories and will like the fact that the small can will fit in their purse . I doubt whether other new products will be successful , including a new coffee-flavored soda called Coke-Cola Blak that I tried . Think carbonated coffee . But I&rsquo;m not sure if the product , which Coke is pitching as an afternoon pick-me-up for the 35-and-over set , is going to pull people away from their afternoon Frappucino fix . And my opinion is that Vault , an orange-flavored energy drink , will have just as much trouble unseating Mountain Dew among teens as did Coke&rsquo;s last attempt , a product called Surge .</p>
<p>If there is one concern I have about the fresh offerings Coke plans to launch this year , it appears that many of them are simply new brands , not new products .</p>
<p>68．According to the passage , we can know that .</p>
<p>A．Coke mainly depends on new products recently</p>
<p>B．Nowadays Coke is comparatively less popular</p>
<p>C．PesiCo has taken the place of Coke</p>
<p>D．Coke has few new brands</p>
<p>69．The underlined word &ldquo;soared&rdquo; means .</p>
<p>A．achieved B．dropped C．increased D．failed</p>
<p>70．When the middle-aged people feel tired , what would they prefer to drink in order to continue their work ?</p>
<p>A．Vault. B．Surge. C．Coke-Cola Blak. D．Frappucino.</p>
<p>71．What is the best title of the passage ?</p>
<p>A．Troubles in Coke Company B．Varieties of New Products</p>
<p>C．The Importance of New Advertisements D．The Relationship Between Coke and Pepsi</p>

<p>Possible Version</p>
<p>March 14, 2006 Sunny</p>
<p>It was a special day because I took the Final P.E. Test for senior Three students .</p>
<p>The sun was shining brightly and we reached the stadium by bus . Under the guidance of the teacher , we gathered in groups at the entrance . Before the 1500-metre race , we had a five-minute warm-up, but I felt a little nervous because I was not doing well in long-distance running . With the teacher&rsquo;s order , we began to run as fast as we could . Towards the end of the race , I was so tired that my pace slowed down and several runners caught up with me . However , encouraged by my classmates , I kept running with every effort . Finally I crossed the finishing line at 5&prime;40&Prime;. To my delight , this is the best result I have gotten in a 1500-metre race .</p>
<p>Today I was a success ! Not only did I challenge the strength and endurance that a runner needed but also I learned that trying my best would really make a difference .</p>

<p>Text 11</p>
<p>My friend , David kept birds . One day he phoned and told me he was going away for a week . He asked me to feed the birds for him and said that he would leave the key to his front door in my mailbox . Unfortunately , I forgot all about the birds until the night before David was going to return . What was worse , it was already dark when I arrived at his house . I soon found the key David gave me could not unlock either the front door or the back door . I was getting hopeless . I kept thinking of what David would says when he came back .I was just going to give up when I noticed that one bedroom window was slightly open . I found a barrel and pushed it under the window . As the barrel was very heavy , I made a lot of noise . But in the end , I managed to climb up and open the window . I actually had one leg inside the bedroom when I suddenly realized that someone was shining a torch up at me . I looked down and saw a policeman and an old lady , one of David&rsquo;s neighbors . &ldquo;What are you doing up there ?&rdquo; asked the policeman . Feeling like a complete fool , I replied , &ldquo;I was just going to feed Mr. David&rsquo;s birds .&rdquo;</p>
